# Asthma Care openEHR Archetype Template

## Description
This repository contains the openEHR archetype templates developed for an Asthma Care system. These templates were designed to enhance the uniformity of data storage, facilitate efficient data retrieval and ensure interoperability in the Asthma Care process.

## Archetypes
The templates in this repository cover various stages of the Asthma Care process, including initial patient assessment, asthma diagnosis, and development of personalised asthma action plan. They are a mix of existing archetypes and bespoke archetypes developed to meet the specific needs of the Asthma Care system.

## Modifications
Some existing archetypes were modified due to constraints in the original structure. For example, the diagnostic/report archetype was restructured to incorporate allergen tests in the lab results section.

## Usage
To use these templates, download or clone the repository and import the files into your openEHR template management tool.
